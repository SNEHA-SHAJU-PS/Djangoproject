<h1 class="x">web page</h1>
<p>A web page is a structured document. The core element of a web page is a text file written in the HyperText Markup Language (HTML)[4] which specifies the content of the web page (including links called hyperlinks) to other web resources, primarily other web pages, and to different sections of the same web page). Multimedia content on the web, such as images, videos, and other web pages, can be directly embedded in a web page to form a compound document.</p>
<p>A web page (or webpage) is a document on the World Wide Web "with its own address".[1] Web pages are delivered by a web server to the user and displayed in a web browser[2] to act as a "retrieval unit" for the information stored within it.[3] A website consists of many web pages linked together under a common domain name. The name "web page" is a metaphor of paper pages bound together into a book.</p>
